"""
Rate limiting utilities for NBA API calls.

The NBA API can throttle or block requests if we make too many calls too quickly.
This module helps prevent that by adding small delays between API calls.

We wait at least 600ms (0.6 seconds) between each call, which is what the
NBA API maintainers recommend to avoid getting blocked.
